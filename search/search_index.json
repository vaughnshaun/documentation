Due to the many benefits of the cloud (rapid deployment, scalability, disaster recovery, cost savings, etc), Many organizations are moved away from traditional data centers. Notably, Netflix decommissioned its data centers and are fully in the public cloud.</p>"},{"location":"azure/certifications/az-900/cloud-concepts/cloud-computing/#cloud-models","title":"Cloud Models","text":"<p>Organizations can decide to partially or fully integrate with the cloud.

Azure implements this via Azure stack. Azure stack is a set of vendor specific servers and Microsoft software. The servers are shipped to the customers\u2019 data centers. The Azure stack software virtualizes the servers and provides a UI like the Azure portal. This has the benefit of giving the customer granular control and full control of data like PHI. However, customers still need to maintain the data centers.</p>"},{"location":"azure/certifications/az-900/cloud-concepts/cloud-computing/#public","title":"Public","text":"<p>This is a fully managed model. Customers use Microsoft's data centers. Physical server resources are shared with other customers. There is an option for a non-shared isolated server, but the cost is much more. Resources are fully managed by Microsoft. This enables the full benefit of the cloud.</p>"},{"location":"azure/certifications/az-900/cloud-concepts/cloud-computing/#hybrid","title":"Hybrid","text":"<p>This model is a combination of private and public. An example is having an on-prem database while having a web app deployed in the public cloud. A hybrid approach is typically used for incremental migration to the public cloud.

Application to fully operate, layers must be managed. There are 8 layers: Network, storage, servers (physical hosts, data center, physical network, etc), Virtualization, operating system, runtime, and application. At any given layer, Azure, the customer, or both are responsible. The responsible party is dependent on the chosen service type.</p>"},{"location":"azure/certifications/az-900/cloud-concepts/cloud-computing/#service-types","title":"Service Types","text":"<p>There are three service models.

Azure handles things like networking, runtime, operating systems, disaster recovery, scaling, etc. With platform as a service, multiple server instances can be provisioned with little to no maintenance. App service is an example of this. </p> <p>Both the customer and Microsoft must ensure the security of the network. Customers should keep accounts and data secure. The network should be properly managed utilizing such concepts as network security groups.</p>"},{"location":"azure/certifications/az-900/cloud-concepts/cloud-computing/#saas","title":"SaaS","text":"<p>Software as a service is the most high-level service type.

It allows businesses to produce at speeds much greater than the pre cloud generation. It is the basis for most technology nowadays.

Most people say, \"oh cloud is just a bunch of computers networked together\". While this statement is true, it minimizes the true definition of the cloud. </p> <p>The cloud is a distributed network of computers. Cloud providers use proprietary virtualization technology to share compute resources. This ensures that no compute resources are wasted. The cloud enables quick provisioning of resources without the need of maintenance.</p> <p>Cloud offers 4 basic benefits to users.</p> <ol> <li>Delivery - Delivery of compute resources. </li> <li>Cloud - Resources provisioned from the internet. Traditional data centers not needed. </li> <li>Pay as you go - Pay for what you use. </li> <li>Competition - Fast deployment to beat competition.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"azure/certifications/az-900/cloud-concepts/overview/#microsoft-azure","title":"Microsoft Azure","text":"<p>Azure is a cloud service by Microsoft. To get started with Azure, a Microsoft account is required. To start creating resources, two basic units are required. A subscription should be created to manage billing. Multiple subscriptions can be created under one account. Multiple subscriptions are useful for creating separate billing: per department, application, etc.</p> <p>After creating a subscription, a resource group should be created. A resource group is created under a subscription. A resource group is a logical grouping of resources. A resource must belong to a group and can only belong to one. A common pattern is to have one group per environment region. For example rg-dev-myapp-centralus. A resource is a basic unit of the Azure cloud. </p>"},{"location":"azure/certifications/az-900/cloud-concepts/overview/#provision-resources","title":"Provision Resources","text":"<p>Azure allows for the provisioning of resources.
